<p>What is that? Well, it is like crosscountry skiing, but with a backpack and offroad. aka: Badass cool shit.
Last weekend I had my first cross backcountry skiing experience. It was amazing. Therefore I thought of writing about it in case anyone wants to do it or is about to do it and wants to know how to be prepared.
This is based on my experience. Following, I describe the conditions as well as the equipment I took with me that worked. I would do it again with the same gear. I also add some extra things that could help taking with you.</p>
