I wanted to go out of the city, especially because the week before the long weekend was going to be a busy one at work. Hikes were an option or even a cheap flight with Ryanair somewhere. Imagination gave way to dangerous ideas, and within a blink I was receiving the confirmation email for a round flight to Iceland.</description></item><item><title>The Mexican Hostel Rules</title><link>https://jost.life/assets/mexicanhostelrules/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2022 10:25:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jost.life/assets/mexicanhostelrules/</guid><description>Thanks for your visit at The Mexican Hostel.

Well, it is like crosscountry skiing, but with a backpack and offroad. aka: Badass cool shit. Last weekend I had my first cross backcountry skiing experience. It was amazing. Therefore I thought of writing about it in case anyone wants to do it or is about to do it and wants to know how to be prepared. This is based on my experience. Following, I describe the conditions as well as the equipment I took with me that worked.</description></item><item><title>Winterrun</title><link>https://jost.life/assets/winterrun/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 13:27:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jost.life/assets/winterrun/</guid><description>A year ago I was wondering what gear would I need to run during winter. With winter I mean: Snow and minus degrees. Now, I can tell, based on experience, how it is like to run in the snow, and what kind of equipment is needed to enjoy a nice cold run.
With the following gear I would dare to run from temperatures of -1°C to -12°C.
Gear Technical beanie Bandana Thermal long sleve baselayer t-shirt Running t-shirt Running gloves Running short tights Thermal baselayer legging Socks Winter running spikes Running shoes Wind + Waterproof lightjacket Lipbalm *If you still find it very cold, you can add a thin cotton hoodie, nevertheless I always get very warm after 10 minutes of running without a hoodie.</description></item><item><title>Lifehacks</title><link>https://jost.life/assets/lifehacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 23:50:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jost.life/assets/lifehacks/</guid><description>Practical stuff that can upgrade your everyday.

Here I propose some questions to ask before going out of our rooms:
What do I want to accomplish today? Who might be having a hard time today that i can help? With hom haven&amp;rsquo;t I spoken in a long time that I can contact today? What did I miss yesterday that I can do today?</description></item><item><title>Nightbalance</title><link>https://jost.life/assets/nightbalance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 12:11:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jost.life/assets/nightbalance/</guid><description>At night, when the day is gone and nothing is left but to sleep to be fully charged for the next day, the next challenge, it is worth having a small reflection to overview how our day has been and how have we been. Here I propose some questions to reflect before going to bed in order to improve:
What have I done today? How much time did I invest in each thing today?</description></item><item><title>Simplicity</title><link>https://jost.life/thoughts/simplicity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 23:54:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jost.life/thoughts/simplicity/</guid><description>&amp;ndash;Still a Draft&amp;ndash;
Stay minimalist; it&amp;rsquo;ll help you focus on the important things.
Last year I only had one pair of shoes. For two years I&amp;rsquo;ve only had one swimming suit. From a friend of mine I learned that one should buy a sweater because one needs to get warm, not because just likes it. I learned from one of my best friends that a carry-on backpack is enough to live a semester abroad.</description></item><item><title>Studentmenu</title><link>https://jost.life/assets/studentmenu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 12:58:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jost.life/assets/studentmenu/</guid><description>Meal ideas for Student life.

People are infinite - for sure you might have also heard the phrase &amp;rsquo;each person is a world&amp;rsquo;. Well, for me this phrase is very true. Along our lives we get to know a lot of people. I think there&amp;rsquo;s already studies about that (I&amp;rsquo;ll add the numbers later).</description></item><item><title>Yo</title><link>https://jost.life/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 15:50:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jost.life/about/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, I suppose, is because you got interested and wanted to know more.

So, this is my first draft. That means&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t take it too seriously and don&amp;rsquo;t judge this that hard lol.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to summarize a person in words, because persons are infinite.
What can I say about myself? - That is way better to get to know me in person.</description></item><item><title>Ireland</title><link>https://jost.life/travels/europe/ireland/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 11:37:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jost.life/travels/europe/ireland/</guid><description>TBW.</description></item><item><title>Lyfe</title><link>https://jost.life/thoughts/lyfe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 10:32:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jost.life/thoughts/lyfe/</guid><description>This is LYFE Life should be written with a Y, to remid us of the joyfullness we should have while living (because the letter Y looks like a person with the arms lifted up to the sky), and to remind to ask ourselves why we are here in this LYFE.
