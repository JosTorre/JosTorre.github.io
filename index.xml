I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying a master in secure information systems and for the 3rd semester (which was a Winter Semester) I decided to do an exchange in Norway (like one month before the start lol). Specifically I did my exchange in Trondheim (3rd biggest city in Norway as of today), which has around 180,000 inhabitants. So basically a little smaller than Linz (the 3rd biggest city in Austria).</description></item><item><title>Austria</title><link>https://jostorre.me/travels/europe/austria/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 17:08:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jostorre.me/travels/europe/austria/</guid><description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m a student in Austria.

Well, it is like crosscountry skiing, but with a backpack and offroad. aka: Badass cool shit. Last weekend I had my first cross backcountry skiing experience. It was amazing. Therefore I thought of writing about it in case anyone wants to do it or is about to do it and wants to know how to be prepared. This is based on my experience. Following, I describe the conditions as well as the equipment I took with me that worked.</description></item><item><title>Winterrun</title><link>https://jostorre.me/assets/winterrun/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 13:27:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jostorre.me/assets/winterrun/</guid><description>A year ago I was wondering what gear would I need to run during winter. With winter I mean: Snow and minus degrees. Now, I can tell, based on experience, how it is like to run in the snow, and what kind of equipment is needed to enjoy a nice cold run.
With the following gear I would dare to run from temperatures of -1°C to -12°C.
Gear Technical beanie Bandana Thermal long sleve baselayer t-shirt Running t-shirt Running gloves Running short tights Thermal baselayer legging Socks Winter running spikes Running shoes Wind + Waterproof lightjacket Lipbalm *If you still find it very cold, you can add a thin cotton hoodie, nevertheless I always get very warm after 10 minutes of running without a hoodie.</description></item><item><title>Lifehacks</title><link>https://jostorre.me/assets/lifehacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 23:50:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jostorre.me/assets/lifehacks/</guid><description>Practical stuff that can upgrade your everyday.

Here I propose some questions to ask before going out of our rooms:
What do I want to accomplish today? Who might be having a hard time today that i can help? With hom haven&amp;rsquo;t I spoken in a long time that I can contact today? What did I miss yesterday that I can do today?</description></item><item><title>Nightbalance</title><link>https://jostorre.me/assets/nightbalance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 12:11:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jostorre.me/assets/nightbalance/</guid><description>At night, when the day is gone and nothing is left but to sleep to be fully charged for the next day, the next challenge, it is worth having a small reflection to overview how our day has been and how have we been. Here I propose some questions to reflect before going to bed in order to improve:
What have I done today? How much time did I invest in each thing today?</description></item><item><title>Simplicity</title><link>https://jostorre.me/thoughts/simplicity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 23:54:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jostorre.me/thoughts/simplicity/</guid><description>&amp;ndash;Still a Draft&amp;ndash;
Stay minimalist; it&amp;rsquo;ll help you focus on the important things.
Last year I only had one pair of shoes. For two years I&amp;rsquo;ve only had one swimming suit. From a friend of mine I learned that one should buy a sweater because one needs to get warm, not because just likes it. I learned from one of my best friends that a carry-on backpack is enough to live a semester abroad.</description></item><item><title>Studentmenu</title><link>https://jostorre.me/assets/studentmenu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 12:58:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jostorre.me/assets/studentmenu/</guid><description>Meal ideas for Student life.

People are infinite - for sure you might have also heard the phrase &amp;lsquo;each person is a world&amp;rsquo;. Well, for me this phrase is very true. Along our lives we get to know a lot of people.
