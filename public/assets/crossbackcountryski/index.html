<p>What is that? Well, it is like crosscountry skiing, but with a backpack and offroad. aka: Badass cool shit.
Last weekend I had my first cross backcountry skiing experience. It was amazing. Therefore I thought of writing about it in case anyone wants to do it or is about to do it and wants to know how to be prepared.
This is based on my experience. Following, I describe the conditions as well as the equipment I took with me that worked. I would do it again with the same gear. I also add some extra things that could help taking with you.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#context">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Location: Langlandsvollen, Trondelag, Norway, in the middle of Norway (lol).</li>
<li>Temperature: -12°C to -15°C</li>
<li>Weather: Clear sky / no wind.</li>
<li>Distance to Goal: 6km (geodesic).</li>
</ul>
<p>We, a group of 4 people, were to reach a cabin in the middle of the wilderness to spend the night there and come back next day. We planned to go there by cross country skiing. Weather conditiones were kind of extreme as we had very cold temperatures and a lot of snow. We had the coordinates of the cabin and that was basically it.</p>

<p>To be honest, the weather conditions were kind of challenging, but we were very lucky to have clear sky. Our experience would have been completely different if we&rsquo;d have had other weather conditions. It makes a great difference to have low wind breeze than snowing conditions and even more at -12°C.</p>
<p>Fortunately, because of clear skies, we would enjoy of the great landscapes that Trondelag offers, even when the sun comes out at 9:30 a.m. and goes down at 2:45 p.m. in this time of the year.
Beware, even if its &lsquo;sunny&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll get cold really fast at this temperature. Already after 6 seconds of taking my gloves out for putting on my ski boots I could feel my hands get really cold. During the trail it is the same, if you are to make pauses, make them as short as possible in order not to get too cold. If you want to take a picture, don&rsquo;t take off your gloves for that long, as to get back the warmth in the fingers is not as fast as you&rsquo;d think. Also, try to maintain everything dry; socks and gloves above all.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/pics/xcountryski.jpg" alt="x country skiing"  />
</p>
<p>During our trail I realized how easy it was to advance with cross country skis compared to just walking. The snow was quite deep (I would calculate about 30cm deep for every step), and as we were on a river and lake region, it was very easy to step into unfrozen water now and then if you were just wearing boots. Fortunately, with crosscountry skis there&rsquo;s not this problem. As the last days it had snowed enough, we could advance in any direction we wanted. Snow covered the whole place making it easy to go over rocks, bushes, rivers, hills, and lakes somethimes without noticing. Lakes and rivers were frozen enough to cross them by foot in almost all of the cases.
I must say this was a magical experience, just in the middle of the nature, with noone else around. I must say, it was pretty unique.
Water froze just after 30 mins of walking. That is why bringing thermos is very important. Additionally I bring mate. I think it helps in some way I still havent found out.
After a while, we arrive to the cabin just after it got dark. The cabin was very cold and to start the fire was the next challenge. Luckily, one of us was experienced with it and made it quite fast and with few resources as we didn&rsquo;t have firestarters. Nevertheless it did take long (about 3 hours) for the small cabin to get warm. S we kept all our clothes on for the next hours, even the beanies! My phone&rsquo;s battery died short after we arrived to the cabin. Because of that, I would recommend having a power bank as your phone might be your only way back because of the maps and navigation or even in case of emergency calls.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/pics/xcountrybreal.jpg" alt="x country bereal"  />
</p>
<p>With candles, we had some light and ate our lunch. Later on, we boiled some water out of snow. If you&rsquo;ve done this before, you might know that snow is normally not that clean, but if you boil it before drinking everything should be fine.
Next, we cooked some pasta pesto and during the evening we drank some beer, wine and spirits. I must say that the most intelligent to pack is spirits (strong alcohol). With little of it you get warm and it&rsquo;s effective enough. Nevertheless I would naver say no to a nice cold beer even with the given weather conditions. Fortunately, the bottle of red wine didn&rsquo;t freeze because it was packed inside the backpack, otherwise I&rsquo;m sure it would have been frozen. Actually, some beers got frozen.
Funnily, even my bread got frozen, luckily the rest of the things I packed didn&rsquo;t get frozen.
This is something everyone should take into consideration when buying the groceries for such a hike. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it is normal to think about the freezing temperature of a product when you buy it. For example, what&rsquo;s the frozen temperature of mayonnaise? Well, I don&rsquo;t know either, but it did got frozen lol. So take that into consideration for your winter hike.
For the night I used my sleeping bag for -7°C and it was enough as the cabin had been heated by the stove and the fire burnt until 2 a.m. Next day in the morning the cabin was already very cold (I didn&rsquo;t feel it in my sleeping bag but in my face and as soon as I got out of it). But yes, I&rsquo;d say my sleeping bag was enough for a cabin in this conditions but maybe not enough for camping; I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The way back was just as nice as the way to the cabin. I boiled some water for the way back and put it on my thermo. I checked that everything I had was dry and was ready to go.</p>
<p>So at the end one of us got frostbitten in the toes because of moist in the boots. Therefore the importance of everything being dry as possible. Life hack: bring at least 2 pairs of wool socks; it is worth changing them before starting the way back even though the used ones are still dry. \ One of us couldn&rsquo;t ski because the skis were broken. This resulted in him doing the hike by foot and getting big bruises in both ankles at the end of the hike. In this situation, just make sure that your shoes are comfortable enough and fit you perfectly, otherwise you might end up in the same or a worse situation. Last of all make sure you have the endurance to make this hike.</p>
<p>Finally I would definitely do it again and would recommend to any enthusiasts to experience this. If you have any questions or want any firther advice, please reach out to me on my socials.</p>
<p>God bless.</p>
