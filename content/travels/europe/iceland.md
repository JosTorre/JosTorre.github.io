T-9 days a good friend of mine and I were deciding what do do during the long weekend. I wanted to go out of the city, especially because the week before the long weekend was going to be a busy one at work. Hikes were an option or even a cheap flight with Ryanair somewhere. Imagination gave way to dangerous ideas, and within a blink I was receiving the confirmation email for a round flight to Iceland. 

Here one of my first impressions of Iceland:

The lines that you may see at the bottom of the photo are highways. That might give you some size scale perspective.

Once landed, we went directly to the car rental. We found out through chatGPT about *Blue Car Rental*. We didn't choose one of the international car companies because their prices for insurance were unfair, as cars should already be mostly insured in Iceland, paying extra shouldn't be required. I must tell that my experience picking up the car was way better than what I'm used to with other companies. We just needed to basically scan our QR code that was sent by email after reserving and paying online, go to the counter, confirm that the reservation details were correct, and immediately we got the car keys. All these steps were done in less than 3 minutes; a dream. Of course, we booked the cheapest car available.

So here is the first impresion I had on ground from Iceland:

Yes, there are no trees.
In the early days of Iceland, there were some trees, but settlers deforested and because of obvious climate and soil conditions none grew back. That created the erosioned landscape that nowadays we see on Iceland. Now, it has become a hobby for icelanders to plant trees and once a year the tree of the year is selected.

Maybe before I go forward telling about my trip, I should give some facts about Iceland that I learnt:
