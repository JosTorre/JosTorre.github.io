*To the Ketchup Koiene, who made this semester unique and amazing.*

I'm currently studying a master in secure information systems and for the 3rd semester (which was a Winter Semester) I decided to do an exchange in Norway. Specifically I did my exchange in Trondheim (3rd biggest city in Norway as of today), which has around 180,000 inhabitants. So basically a little smaller than Linz (the 3rd biggest city in Austria). For those who don't know, Trondheim is located quite north in Norway, just in the part where the country begins to get thinner, that is about 62° North on the globe.
The reason why I decided Trondheim was because of the NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology) itself. They claim to be the best university in Norway, and after having spent one semester there I do believe it. But I must say, when I was deciding whether to go to Norway or somewhere else, I asked how it was going to be, for which I got for an answer: 'kalt und finster' (which means 'cold and dark' in german).
But first, let me talk about the country.

## Norge / Noreg

So this was my first time here. I had visited other scandinavian countries, but Norway was the only missing. This time I had the chance to get to know it deeply.
What can I say about it? 
It is a very peaceful country, where values of honesty, trust, responsibility, and equality are specially important for the society. The country works based on honesty. Those values in my perspective, rule the way of living here (from a really broad perspective). Nevertheless, something to say is that norwegians are really helpful and welcoming. Even if in most of online blogs and swedish people say they are really unfriendly. But I found out that their friendliness is normally misunderstood or hided by their pragmatism. 

Norwegians in general are really pragmatic. For example, they won't greet you if there's nothing important to say; they won't start a conversation if it's not needed. So at the begining, it is hard to approach norwegians with smalltalk.
Nevertheless, if there's anything you need help with and you express it, they'll be happy to help and they'll make your problem their own. 
So, be the one to take the first step if you want to befriend noregians, or go to a party. Under the influence of alcohol they get totally open and friendly, that's the chance to make friends.

![geirangerfjord](/pics/geiranger.jpg)

The country is incredible, with so few inhabitants, it is possible to really enjoy the nature and peace. Furthermore, its location and nearness to the sea make it have mezmerizing landscapes that seem taken out from a sci-fi movie. Norway its specially known for its Fjords and for Lofoten.

There are two official languages spoken in Norway: Bokmål and Nynorsk. Additionally, almost everyone speaks a very good english, even the older generation can be expected to know how to speak english; I realized this as a norwegian grandma asked me for indications in norwegian and as she saw my confused face, she immediately changed to english (my confused face stayed, but this time I understood what the lady was asking me). Interesting is that norwegians, swedish and danish can communicate between themselves by speaking their own languages.

 ## Trondheim

![tyholt](/pics/tyholt.jpg)

I must say I already miss Trondheim, what a nice city. Before coming, I must say I hadn't eaver heard about it. So it was a big surprise to suddenly be there.
Trondheim started being a viking port and it has been developing sice then. It is located in a fjord and the Nidar river flows through it making a kind of peninsula out of the city's downtown. 
Personally I was living in Moholt Studentby (which translates to Moholt student village/city). This is southern from the city center at a higher elevation because of the hills. 
I must say thet I found Trondheim to be the best student city I've ever been in. For its relative small size, it offers so much. There's shops, malls, multiple bars and restaurants, sport centers and gyms, monuments, history, an old town, an old gothic cathedral and an old town. Of course, there's also so much nature around it as well. To the west theres Bymarka, a huge nature park where you can hike and cross country ski. To the north-east there's Kalvika beach and a long walking path along the coast. To the east there's another nature park with a really nice waterfall. To the south there's also another nature park with a couple of lakes. And I must say there might be so many other spots to mention where anybody can go for a hike and discover. But my point is, yes, there's so much nature around it.

![korsvika](/pics/korsvika.jpg)

The city is also really well connected by bus. Just the airport itslef lies in another city 40 min away by bus more or less. If you're going to Trondheim keep in mind that the bus from the airport to the city takes quite long and it's about 120 NOK for students (one way). If not, there's the possibility to take a train from the airport for about 80 NOK. But the express buses come and go quite often, which might offer the best option.
Whereas the buses from the city, they are really good. It is hard to get a physical ticket, as almost everything in norway works by card or vipps (a norwegian kind of inter-banking paypal service), and for the bis there's an app where you're supposed to buy the tickets. The same app helps you to find your connections from pint A to B, beware that even if Google Maps gives simmilar results for bus connections, they might be wrong. Always use the AtB App when travelling by bus.

Whereas for the weather in Trondheim, I find that for being that north the weather is very friendly. During the Winter Semester (August - December) I can say that there was a little bit of everything. The hihest temperature I had in Trondheim during this period might have been 12°C in August. Nevertheless there were many sunny and blue sky days. But sometimes it can stay cloudy for a whole week. Also, it is very probable that it rains, but most of the time is light rain, not pouring. And of course, between November and December you can get snow.

![daylighttrond](/pics/daylighttrond.jpg)

Now, my favourite thing to talk about, when talking about weather in Trondheim: Light Hours! For me, this was a really impressive experience. As you may already know, Trondheim's location in the northern hemisphere (around 62 degrees north), makes it have very few sunlight hours during the winter. The picture above shows a normal winter day in Trondheim at 12:33pm. Just before my departure, sunrise was happening at 10:00 and sunset at 14:30, which is pretty short. This short duration of the days is because the inclination of the earth towards the sun, and therefore, if you're in Trondheim, you'll always see the sun very low on the horizon, during winter. This gives the effect of the whole day being either a long morning or long afternoon. If there are some clouds at the horizon, you might not see the sun at all. I must say, that this is a very interesting feeling as an exchange student. 
Additionally, norwegians advice on taking OMega3 and Vitamin D supplements everyday to keep that missing energy from the sun. This short daylight makes it easy to capture really nice pictures as all seem to be taken either at sunrise or sunset, becuse the sun never rises that high.

### Places in Trondheim

So where is what and what is there?

For being a relatively small city (from a mexican perspective), Trondheim has much to offer: cafés, restaurants, bars, sports centers, clubs, historical sites and even a beach. For me, Trondheim has just the perfect size; not too big not too small. But here I'll make a small list in case you'll like to visit it someday and are wondering where to go. (Cafes will be discussed in a separate section).

__Restaurants__:
- Tyholt Tower: A tower, which at the top has an Egon restaurant with an amazing view of Trondheim and the Fjord. It is great for sunsets and at certain hours there's a pizza buffet. Expect little from the buffet as the pizzas are simmilar to frozen pizzas and there are not many varieties of them, but it is worth going there as it is 'cheap' (for norwegian standards) and for the view.
- Superhero Burger: Very known place among students to go and have a burger (simmilar to a shake shack burger quality), but expensive. A combo with fries and soda is around 20 EUR.
- Golden Kebab: Best Kebab in town! It might be one the most expensive kebabs you'll ever buy, but it tastes really good. The size is bigger than a normal kebab and has more meat than usual. It is next to some clubs, so ot is the best option after clubbing. 
- Grano: The only pizza in town that was certified by italians to be authentic. At some hours there's a discount, when you can buy a pizza for a reduced price of 11EUR.

__Pubs__:

- __Three Lions__: An english pub. Great to watch football matches, but not the cheapest.
- __Sukkerhuset__: A student managed bar. It has a really nice atmosphere, a stage and a room with billiards. You can find cheap beer there if you're a student.
- __Antikvariaetet__: One of my favourite bars. It has a really nice atmosphere and sometimes with live music. I think on sunday evenings there are music performances. They have some self brewed beer and it is located in an iconic building. The back room  
- Circus: A famous bar in Trondheim.
- __Mormors__: Here you can get a student discount for beer. The place is a typical norwegian old house. They have home made cookies which are also delicious.

__Clubs__:

- __Downtown__: My favourite club in Trondheim. It has two floors with different music. The lower floor plays 80's, 90's and classics, whereas the upper floor has more electric music. Entry costs around 11EUR. Some weekdays are cheaper.
- __Heidi's__: One of the most known clubs as there are filiales in other cities like Oslo. I dind't go to the Trondheim one, but went to the one in Oslo. I remember that entry was a little more expensive than Downtown, but I had a really nice time.
- __Diskoteket__: More like a bar, but at night you can dance and there's a DJ. Not the best place to party, but if you're looking for something between a bar and a club it might make the trick.
- __Studentersamfundet__: A student association's building containing many bars and rooms with different atmospheres inside. When you go there party for the first time it is very probable that you'll get lost inside as it is like a labirynth. If you're a student you can buy a membership or even volunteer and get discount in beer and free entry to some events. Really good place to meet other students.

__Sightseeing__:

- __Kristiansten festing__: A fortress with a small museum on its main building. There's a nice view of the city from there as it is located in a hill.
- __Bakklandet__: The most beatiful and typical part of the city. It is the 'old town' part of the city, with colourful houses and typical businesses. 
- __Skansen__: An old part of the city, with typical norwegian houses. It is located next to the docks and it is a really nice place to go for a walk.
- __Gløshaugen__: The main campus of NTNU. It is an old medieval building, which reminds of Hogwarts.
- __Nidarosdomen__: An old gothic style cathedral. Catholic when it was built, but now it is managed by the chirch of Norway, whose head is the King of Norway.
- __Torvet__ (mainsquare): Here some main events happen, like concerts and the christmass market.
- __Gamle Bybro__: The famous walking bridge in Trondheim from which really nice pictures of the river can be made.

![trndbridge](/pics/trndbridge.jpg)

__Other__:

- __Solsiden__: This is a part of the city next to the harbour where some factories were located. Nowadays you can find nice restaurants, a mall, and on winter one of the channels is turned into a ice skating rink.
- __Bunker Sauna__: Speak-easy place. Formerly, part of a bunker, but later the interiors were remodeled to make a sauna out of it. It can fit around 12 people and it can be booked online. This bunker is next to the fjord so you can go for a swim now and then during the sauna session.
- __Korsvika Beach__: Just for a stroll, to swim or to make a bbq this beach is my favourite in Trondheim. Here we had some bonfire evenings, bbq parties and went for a swim in the cold fjord. If you're in Trondheim, dont doubt in spending a bonfire evening there. It is also a really good place to watch the Aurora Borealis.
- __Bymarka__: A natural reserve on the hill next to the city. It is bigger than you'd expect. There are many hikes you can do there. Also there you can find the Studenterhytta, where you can spend a cabin night with a sauna and a hut tub. Additionally, during winter you can go cross country skiing there. There are few buses that go there and it takes around 1 hour from Moholt, but it is totally worth it.
- __Lerkendal Stadion__: If you like football, you can go to this stadium to watch Trondheim's football team play.

 ### Cafés

As you might know, Norway is one of the top coffee consuming countries per capita, occupying the 2nd place worldwide. And as you might not know, I'm a coffee fan.

![twcoffee](/pics/twcoffee.jpg)

So everything started by a post I made on Reddit asking for the best coffee-shops in Trondheim. I received a couple of answers, and I gave myself the task of visiting every café that was suggested. Here I write my feedback and suggestions:

- __Dromedar Café__: a coffee shop chain, but they have a good service and what you'd expect when going to a coffee shop: 'Good' standard coffee. What I really liked from here has their chili + chocolate + coffee drink, called: Søt Chili. I thought I would only be able to find that in Mexico at Cielito Querido Cafe, but for my surprise there was in Norway as well.
- __Kaffebrenneriet__: My favourite coffee chain in the world. Here's were I bought my coffee beans to brew my own coffee. They have different beans from all over the world and they roast the beans themselves. If you want to buy good reliable quality of coffee go there. They have normally direct contact with the producers and everything is very well documented on the package. Nevertheless if you're looking for a coffeeshop where they brew coffee with different methods, this might not be the place. Anyhow, I really liked that even being a big chain, they can keep coffee standards high and the direct contact with the coffe producers.
- __Jacobsen og Svart__: This is a really nice café to go for a longer time, the interiors were redesigned and it looks just high end. Thez roast their coffee themselves and have some methods like V60. I would definitely recommend. Just the price of the beans is a little more expensive that the ones at Kaffebrenneriet.
- __Café Le Frere__: A really cozy café in the city center. They roast their own coffee and have nice pastries. BUT, they over-roast their coffee. Coffee there tastes like ashes (literally). I went there twice: first for a capuccino and the second time for an espresso. Both tasted like ashes and the second time just made me confirm my theory: The coffee beans were oversoasted. Be as it may, people keep going there and maybe it is the most cozy coffee shop in Trondheim (but I wouldn't recommend the coffee there). Also they don't have Wifi. What kind of café has no Wifi nowadays?
- __Sellanraa__: Last but not least. This was the last coffeeshop I visited. It looks more like a restaurant and on the menu you can find but little about coffee. I actually was going to leave the place because I dind't find any coffee other than americano and espresso on the menu. If it were not for the barista itself that saw me leaving and convinced me to stay, I would have skipped the best of all cafés in Trondheim. I ended up asking for one coffee and having 3 more for free, thanks to the Barista. He is the best in Trondheim. I tried two different espressos, and two different V60. Brewed with different beans. The barista told me about the coffee and he also explained mz the peculiaritz about how espressos are brewed in Norway. One of the reasons why I say that this was the best, is because for the first time in a while, someone could brew me an expresso with different beans to compare (this normally doesn't happen in coffe shops). Finally, they have the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted: chunky as hell, but also very expensive haha. Definitely go to this place. Of course the service was extraordinary. 

*Fun fact: espressos are served with more water in Norway, when compared to italian espressos.*

## NTNU

__Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet__

Just this Winter semester 2021, there were aroung 1,800 international students making an exchange semester at the NTNU.

![ntnucampus](/pics/ntnucampus.jpg)

So there is a lot to be said, but I'll try my best.

To begin, NTNU says it is the best university in Norway and I believe that (except for it's international office). NTNU has mainly two campuses in Trondheim: Gløshaugen and Dragvoll; plus some buildings scattered in the city. I personally went to Gløs (the best according to me). There I studied information security related subjects, like Ethical Hacking and Wireless Network Security. Teachers and staff are really friendly and the contents of the lectures are state of the art. 
I found the teaching method interesting. For example, in one of the classes, we had to watch the prerecorded lectures by oir own and then just attend to class to solve doubts about the topics. I found this very efficient. Most of my classes were at Elektro building (the university has an app: Mazeapp to be able to navigate inside the campus). 
The campus is great, it is beautiful and there are many places where you can study. There are at least two big canteens where you can have lunch and choose from a buffet; whatever you serve will be charged based on weight. There's even a coffee subscription for 11EUR with which you can get coffee in your termo for 1EUR per refill (it wont be the best coffee, but it'll wake you up).
Actually, constantly there are stands on the hallways from companies or student organizations, which as a rule offer free coffee.
At NTNU there are many student organizations as well. For me, I joined Abakus (student organization for information systems). They organize their own events and publish them on their website.
There's much to say, but I think I'm just missing a couple.
At the beginning of the semester, the first two weeks there are a lot of events organized by the university and by student associations. Make sure you attend as many as you can, as there you might get to know most of your friends for the rest of the semester. Some of the best parties are at this time of the semester, because there's no school pressure, so everyone has time to party.
There's also UKA, an event over a couple of weeks that organizes parties, concerts and cultural events. Make sure to get your tickets soon enough because they sold out quickly.

### NTNUI

Finally, I need to talk about NTNU sport organization. This is just amazing and maybe one of the things that make NTNU be the number one. I have never seen such a university sport organization like thi one before. There's such a wide variety of sports that are offered. Some of the offered sports are: Scuba diving, Kayak, Surf, Kitesurf, Sailing, Underwater Rugby, and many others. Plus of course the traditional sports like basketball, swimming, football, etc. 
By paying a semester fee you can participate in any of them and be part of a sportsgroup ('Verein' in german). Just take in mind that some of these have limited spots, so if you are keen to participte in any of these, research the requirements and sign up early.
Myself I became part of Sailing and learnt a lot on the Ynglings at Trondheim's fjord.

NTNUI also has Bumerang, a place from which you can borrow hicking and other equipment for free as a student.

But there's even more. NTNU through NTNUI offers cabins in the wilderness to students. This is called NTNUI Koiene. As a memeber of NTNUI you can book any cabin for the price of 4EUR per person. Cabins are litterally in the middle of Norway and they have no electricity nor water. There's the need of chopping wood to turn the stove on or just to heat yourself from the great cold at night. Some of the cabins have a sauna ;).
If you want to know one of my experiences in one of these cabins read my [post on Cross Country Skiing](https://jostorre.me/assets/crossbackcountryski/).


## Living there

First I just want to show the view from my room in 3 pictures that I took one morning from 8AM to 10AM:

![roomview1](/pics/roomview1.jpg)
8:08AM
![roomview2](/pics/roomview2.jpg)
9:35AM
![roomview3](/pics/roomview3.jpg)
10:05AM

Weather can get crazy up there.

But well, how is it living in Trondheim?

Well there are a lot of students and there are many things for students. There's always something to do and many hikes you can do around the city. Everything is at walking distance, so don't worry if you missed the last bus. I mean, it might take you 45min to get from the club back home, but you'll make it.
As for transport there are Scooters, from which the best are Ryde, becasue they can be use at night most of the times. And there are buses. For them you need to download the app to check the schedules and buy your tickets on the app as well. Buy the monthly tickets as they have some student discount.

To live, there are mainly two options: Student housing and private accomodation. Student housing has some advantages and is easier to book if you get a booking code, and it'll be cheaper, but in private housing it'll be easier to host parties. Either of both will be fine, they just have different pros and cons.

### Sit

Sit is an organization for students. They manage all of the student housing in Trondheim. They also have meeting rooms for students, cafeterias, and gyms. They are everywhere basically, but they are quite good. They even offer free coffe at some places and even free condoms.

I stayed at a Sit student housing at Moholt Studentby. The laundry system worked pretty well as they have enough machines and you can book them and see their status online. Washing costs 20 NOK and drying is for free. There's no need to buy deterget as the machines include it. 

### General Costs

One fact: Norway is expensive.
No further debate.

So if you're going to go to norway prepare to see some expensive prices for what you would pay way less at home.
So the way to make your experience the cheapest is: do it yourself and / or with friends and be ingenious about it.
Restaurants and bars are expensive. If you want to eat something delicious, cook it by yourself at home or get friends to cook for or with you. Plus, be hunting for those discounts. 

For clothes and gear, buy in outlets, they offer just the same quality at lower prices. Hint: Thriftshops in norway was quite nice stuff, so take a look there now and then. 

Some other things you might find cheaper if you buy them for a longer period of time like bus tickets or you might find many student discounts on different services.

### Food

As mentioned before, food is expensive. But there are four main supermarkets in Norway: Bunnpris, Coop, Rema1000, and Kiwi. I ordered them from high to low price according to my experience. But I always went to Rema 1000. For each week of meals I spent around 600 NOK when the cheapest. So be prepared. 
Nevertheless I really like grocery shopping in Norway. I found many new things and the healthiest products from each category are marked with a green seal. Also, there are lots of healthy options: reduced fat, bio, vegan products, and protein rich products. Even though the variety of products is very little at least you can be sure its healthy.
So my nutrition changed completely for the third time when I came to norway. I adapted myself to norwagian cuisine, which according to norwegians is very 'primitive'.

I ate a lot of salmon as it was the only thing I found 'cheap' when compring the prices to the ones at home. And I must say I loved salmon fillets and smoked salmon. If you want to know more about my meals, check my [Student Menu page](https://jostorre.me/assets/studentmenu/).

Some norwegian specialties in case you're wondering are:
- Brunost (brown cheese).
- Waffles (thinner than belgian ones).
- Raindeer Salami.
- Fiskburger (fish burger).
- Cloudberries.
- Makrell (type of sigh sold in cans with tomato sauce).
- Herring (fish aged with vinegar and sugar).
- Likorice (with different flavours).
- Whale meat (in norway it is allowed).
- Taco Friday (yes, norwegians eat tacos on Fridays).
*Norwegian Tacos are not as in Mexico*

Finally TRAN. This is fish oil, which is recommended to have daily to prepare for the winter time. As during winter, the sunligh hours are very short, there can be a lack of vitamin D, and also lack of energy. Having a daily dosis of tran helps having energy to carry on during the day and have a healthy body.

### Alcohol

One word: VINOMONOPOLET. Yes, The Vino Monopoly, and no, its not the name of a board game. In Norway, there's just one store that sells alcoholic beverages Vinomonopolet, which is state owned. Beers and Ciders can be found in supermarkets during the unrestricted hours. The rest can only be found at Vinomomopolet, and normally at an expensive price.

In Norway one may only buy alcoholic beverages from Mon - Fri from 9AM - 8PM and on Sat from 9AM to 4PM. There's no sell of alcohol on Sun. So everytime you have a party be sure you first buy the alcohol for it during the allowed hours. Also have always a six pack of beer in the fridge in case a spontaneus party pops up or some friends come by. 

Of course, as most of the things in Norway, alcohol is expensive. No wonder why everyone thinks twice before gifting a beer during a party. What is also rare to see. The cheapest beer for 20 NOK you can find at supermarkets is BARE ØL, which in my opinion is a pretty decent beer. Additionally for a couple of more crowns, there's DAHLS which is brewed in Trondheim and has an amazing Juløl (christmas beer), and Frydenlund which is also bought by norwegians. 

![trndbeer](/pics/trndbeer.jpg)

If not beer then Wine. At Vinomonopolet you can buy wine. The best for partys is to buy a box of wine, which has a plastic bag containing the equivalent of 3 bottles of wine and a dispenser. A really interesting concept I must say. This might cost around 300 NOK depending on the brand. The cheapest one is from *Concha y Toro*.

Finally, strong alcohols are really expensive. A bottle of Absolut vodka (which is swedish) will cost above 300 NOK. So if you're going to party parner up with some friends to buy a bottle or go to Sweden to buy some cheaper (alcohol is cheaper in Sweden). 
If you're driving to Norway by car, make sure you bring enough bottles for your stay :).

These alcohol prices are also the explanation why some norwegians actually prefer to brew their own beer.

### Winter

Winter can get pretty harsh in Norway, reaching -20°C. Fortunately Trondheim gets insulated by the sea and doesn't reach that low temperatures that often. For example, during winter we had -10°C while the water in the fjord was at 7°C. But if you go inland there you can get really cold. 
But the worst weather in Trondheim is when its 1°C to 0°C and is raining. 

The best gear is a thick wool sweater plus a rainjacket, when raining or a wool sweater plus an insulation jacket or ski jacket when colder.
Of course gloves and a beanie are important, and if you get really cold, then use thermal underwear as well.

Maybe the best tip I can give when speaking about wearables is to have a pair of waterproof hicking boots. You'll use them quite often in Trondheim.

But don't be afraid of the cold weather, below 7°C it feels the same, your hands just get colder quicker when you take out your gloves to use your phone.
The best tip when going for a hike on cold weather is to bring a thermo with boiling water.

The best app to check the weather forecast is [YR](https://www.yr.no/).

### Sport

Being sporty in Trondheim is very easy. Sit has various GYMs in the city: Moholt, Gløshaugen, Portalen, and Dragvoll are the most known ones. If you buy the membership you'll be able to go to any of them during the whole day. They also offer different fitness clases. Inside this centers you can find basketball and even squash courts. 

If you like to swim, there's Pirbadet, where you can buy a membership and go train there, or just join NTNUI swimming group. 
If you're into running, there are lots of circuits you can make in Trondheim, the city is just perfect for running, even during winter. Check out my page where I tell about [running in winter](https://jostorre.me/assets/winterrun/). But to check some already done circuits you can use [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/).

### Aurora Borealis

What many are expecting when comming to Norway. Do whatever you want, but never book a tour to watch the northern lights (I never did), but there's no greatest scam. Nobody knows with certainty when are they going to be seen.
Of course there're some forecasts on when are they most probably going to appear, but they are just accurate some hours before. 

![moholtborealis](/pics/moholtborealis.jpg)

So according to me there are 5 main factors that will affect you northern light experience, from which the 1st is pure luck.

2. Position on earth: The northern you are the more visible and more probable it is to see them.
3. KPI index: The higher KPI index the stronger the lights are going to be 8 or 9 is damn strong.
4. Weather: If its cloudy you won't see a thing.
5. Light pollution: If you're far from civilization you'll see them better, also if there's no moon they're going to be better.

When there are northern lights but the KPI index is low, you might be able to see some thick gray lines in the sky. If you do, take a picture with your phone on night mode and you'll see the colours of the northern lights on the photo. 
But when the KPI index is high, you can see them with your bare eyes as in the movies!

Some stuff a norwegian told me is that the rarest to see is purple northern lights and that sometimes you can hear them. Of course, he came from the northernmost town in Norway, and that's why he knew that.

## Trips

If you go to Norway, don't stay in you room. There is so much to discover. The best tourism in Norway is related to nature. Of course you might also want to visit Bergen or Oslo as I did, but I assure you, the best will be the nature. Tip: in Norway it is allowed to camp everywhere, so if you have the right gear and like it, there's a way to save some money. If you don't have the gear you can borrow it from NTNUI Bumerang. 

Something important to consider for your trips during Winter Semester is not to wait until the end. It is better to make as many trips as you can at the beginning and just eave the ski trips for the end. Some people tend to think that going to Lofoten at the end of the semester is ok, but there might be a couple of hours sunligh or even polar night at that time. If you want to do the hikes and enjoy the views go before.

Connections to and back in Norway are pretty bad, so plan your trip in advance and don't miss a bus, ferry or train as you might need to wait until next day to catch the next.

Of course the best way to travel in Norway is by car. Rent a car if possible and get student discount with Sixt Rental. If the distance is longer, take a plane, some companies also have student discounts.

Finally, here I leave some pictures of the trips I made. Details I keep for myself as they are unique personal experiences. But feel free to ask me any questions about them on my socials.

## Lessons Learned

- Check connections before booking trips.
- Take Tran during winter.
- Ask for student discounts.
