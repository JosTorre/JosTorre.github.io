I'm currently studying a master in secure information systems and for the 3rd semester (which was a Winter Semester) I decided to do an exchange in Norway. Specifically I did my exchange in Trondheim (3rd biggest city in Norway as of today), which has around 180,000 inhabitants. So basically a little smaller than Linz (the 3rd biggest city in Austria). For those who don't know, Trondheim is located quite north in Norway, just in the part where the country begins to get thinner, that is about 62° North on the globe.
The reason why I decided Trondheim was because of the NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology) itself. They claim to be the best university in Norway, and after having spent one semester there I do believe it. But I must say, when I was deciding whether to go to Norway or somewhere else, I asked how it was going to be, for which I got for an answer: 'kalt und finster' (which means 'cold and dark' in german).
But first, let me talk about the country.

## Norway

So this was my first time here. I had visited other scandinavian countries, but Norway was the only missing. This time I had the chance to get to know it deeply.
What can I say about it? 
It is a very peaceful country, where values of honesty, trust, responsibility, and equality are specially important for the society, Those values in my perspective, rule the way of living here (from a really broad perspective). Nevertheless, something to say is that norwegians are really helpful and welcoming. Even if in most of online blogs and swedish people say they are really unfriendly. But I found out that their friendliness is normally misunderstood or hided by their pragmatism. 
Norwegians in general are really pragmatic. For example, they won't greet you if there's nothing important to say; they won't start a conversation if it's not needed. So at the begining, it is hard to approach norwegians with smalltalk.
Nevertheless, if there's anything you need help with and you express it, they'll be happy to help and they'll make your problem their own. 
So, be the one to take the first step if you want to befriend noregians, or go to a party. Under the influence of alcohol they get totally open and friendly, that's the chance to make friends.

The country is incredible, with so few inhabitants, it is possible to really enjoy the nature and peace. Furthermore, its location and nearness to the sea make it have mezmerizing landscapes that seem taken out from a sci-fi movie. Norway its specially known for its Fjords and for Lofoten.

 ## Trondheim

I must say I alreadyb miss Trondheim, what a nice city. Before coming, I must say I hadn't eaver heard about it. So it was a big surprise to suddenly be there.
Trondheim started being a viking port and it has been developing sice then. It is located in a fjord and the Nidar river flows through it making a kind of peninsula out of the city's downtown. 
Personally I was living in Moholt Studentby (which translates to Moholt student village/city). This is southern from the city center at a higher elevation because of the hills. 
I must say thet I found Trondheim to be the best student city I've ever been in. For its relative small size, it offers so much. There's shops, malls, multiple bars and restaurants, sport centers and gyms, monuments, history, an old town, an old gothic cathedral and an old town. Of course, there's also so much nature around it as well. To the west theres Bymarka, a huge nature park where you can hike and cross country ski. To the north-east there's Kalvika beach and a long walking path along the coast. To the east there's another nature park with a really nice waterfall. To the south there's also another nature park with a couple of lakes. And I must say there might be so many other spots to mention where anybody can go for a hike and discover. But my point is, yes, there's so much nature around it.

The city is also really well connected by bus. Just the airport itslef lies in another city 40 min away by bus more or less. If you're going to Trondheim keep in mind that the bus from the airport to the city takes quite long and it's about 120 NOK for students (one way). If not, there's the possibility to take a train from the airport for about 80 NOK. But the express buses come and go quite often, which might offer the best option.
Whereas the buses from the city, they are really good. It is hard to get a physical ticket, as almost everything in norway works by card or vipps (a norwegian kind of inter-banking paypal service), and for the bis there's an app where you're supposed to buy the tickets. The same app helps you to find your connections from pint A to B, beware that even if Google Maps gives simmilar results for bus connections, they might be wrong. Always use the AtB App when travelling by bus.

Whereas for the weather in Trondheim, I find that for being that north the weather is very friendly. During the Winter Semester (August - December) I can say that there was a little bit of everything. The hihest temperature I had in Trondheim during this period might have been 12°C in August. Nevertheless there were many sunny and blue sky days. But sometimes it can stay cloudy for a whole week. Also, it is very probable that it rains, but most of the time is light rain, not pouring. And of course, between November and December you can get snow.

Now, my favourite thing to talk about, when talking about weather in Trondheim: Light Hours! For me, this was a really impressive experience. As you may already know, Trondheim's location in the northern hemisphere makes it have fery few sunlight hours during the winter. Days become shorter. Just before my departure, sunrise was happening at 10:00 and sunset at 14:30, which is pretty short. This short duration of the days is because the position of the earth towards the sun, and therefore, if you're in Trondheim, you'll always see the sun very low on the horizon. This gives the effect of the whole day being either a long morning or long afternoon. If there are some clouds at the horizon, you might not see the sun at all. I must say, that this is a very interesting feeling as an exchange student. 
Additionally, norwegians advice on taking OMega3 and Vitamin D supplements everyday to keep that missing energy from the sun.
