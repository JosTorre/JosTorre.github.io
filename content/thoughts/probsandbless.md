If we think about our problems, almost any problem exists because of the existence of a bigger good that we have.
I'm not talking about any way to solve problems, but about a change of perspective that keeps us from being overwhelmed by a problem and take better decisions by being conscious about what we have.

i.e. any problem relating any friend, could be seen as a blessing because we have a friend. 

Our blessings, opportunities, and possessions will bring hard decisions or problems with them, but thanks to the original fact that we have a greater blessing.
If we didn't have anything, we wouldn't have any problems, but ourselves. And if the problem lies within us, it is thanks to the blessing of our own existence.

Then, next time that you have a problem or a tough decision to make, take a moment and be grateful of having that problem, for that means that you have a greater blessing.
