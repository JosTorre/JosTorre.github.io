Stay minimalist; it'll help you focus on the important things.

Last year I only had one pair of shoes.
For two years I've only had one swimming suit.
From a friend of mine I learned that one should buy a sweater because one needs to get warm, not because one wants.
I learned from one of my best friends that a carry-on backpack is enough to live a semester abroad.

I don't claim any of the above to be accomplishments. I know people who live in great poverty, from which myself and many others could learn from about life.

How much value do we put on material stuff?
What should we let go?

What we wear or have doesn't make us better. What can make us better is what we do with what we have; if we help others with it.

Sacrifice the unimportant for the important, you won't regret it.

What's not important?
    - What you possess.
    - How you dress.

What's important?
    - Who you really are.
    - The people around you.
    - What you do with what you have.
    - What you desire.
    - What you do with the time you have.
