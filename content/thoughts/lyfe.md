### This is LYFE

![lyfe](/pics/lyfe.jpg)

Life should be written with a Y, to remid us of the joyfullness we should have while living (because the letter Y looks like a person with the arms lifted up to the sky), and to remind to ask ourselves why we are here in this LYFE.

hello! Wake up!

Life is now and you don't want to miss it, because it won't last forever.
You have the chance now, use it.

If we were just must concious about how short is life, we would live more fully, feel more deeply, dare more, and regret less.

I remember how I told a good friend of mine how much I missed the summer camp I went to in Italy in which we both were. I told him I wanted to go back next year. To what he answered: "Even if you go back it won't be the same. Each oportunity is unique, and next time if you go, it'll be also unique but not the same. And that's why life is beautiful."
