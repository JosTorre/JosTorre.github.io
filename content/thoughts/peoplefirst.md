## It's not about where, but who with

There's a reason why I always save contacts with name and surname; people are important.
People are infinite - for sure you might have also heard the phrase 'each person is a world'. Well, for me this phrase is very true. 
Along our lives we get to know a lot of people. I think there's already studies about that (I'll add the numbers later). Unfortunately for us and for others, our minds work by categorizing information. That's the reason why we at first categorize people through labels: funny, shy, rich, fat, etc. This lableling people is a generalization, and each generalization is a mistaken fact or better said a lie, because there's always exceptions. As Kierkegaard would say 'Once you label me you negate me.'. Therefore we should be always open to people without prejudices. 

It is not until we get to know a person in a deeper way, that the number of etiqutes stop making sense. At this point we stop adding labels to a person, and we start perceiving the person as a unique soul with infinite attributes instead of labels. And it is at this point that only one's name turns into that unique label for that infinate universe.
Because everyone comes from different origins and has had different experiences that have molded him or her, we should stay open and try to understand why the person is that way and why the person thinks like that. Just through understanding can a stronger bond be formed. That's the reason why with people alike to us (who share same thoughts, principles and/or expericenes) are easier to make more profound bonds with. Because we can easier understand them. But that doesn't mean we cannot get closer to people who are different to us in ways of thinking and being.

Stay open to people. Open your mind and hold your values tight. For being open to new people is also a challenge. Many times you'll disagree or agree in points of view. But when you disagree, look for the truth. Be open for new ideas that might take you a step closer to the truth, as nobody is ever completely right. And for those things, which you know that you're right about, leave always a door open for people not sharing the same point of view to get closer to the truth through you.
