## It's not about where, but who with

There's a reason why I always save contacts with name and surname; people are important.
People are infinite - for sure you might have also heard the phrase 'each person is a world'. Well, for me this phrase is very true. 
Along our lives we get to know a lot of people. I think there's already studies about that (I'll add the numbers later). Unfortunately for us and for others, our minds work by categorizing information. That's the reason why we categorize people through labels. This lableling people is a generalization, and each generalization is a mistaken fact or better said a lie, because there's always exceptions. We should be always open to people without prejudices. 
It is not until we get to know a person in a deeper way, that the number of etiqutes stop making sense. At this point we stop adding labels to a person, and we start perceiving the person as a unique soul with infinite attributes instead of labels. 
Because everyone comes from different origins and has had different experiences that have molded him or her, we should stay open and try to understand why the person is that way and why the person thinks like that. Just through understanding can a better relationship be formed. That's the reason why with people alike to us (who share same thoughts, principles and/or expericenes) we can make easier and more profound bonds. 

There's so much I want to saaay haha. TBC...
