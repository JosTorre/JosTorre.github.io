### Miscelaneous Quote Knowledge Base

This is a list of quotes that I've found during my time living. If they are in this page is because they have at least made myself thought or question myself (the quotes on this page are not ordered).

Quotes are a great source of inspiration and may be used as an excuse to change our way of living for better.
Following, my quote knowledge base:
