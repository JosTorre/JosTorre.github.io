Once a wise person told me: the 20's is a very important phase in your life, on top of which the rest of your life will be built. If you make nothing, it'll be hard when you hit 30, but if you make the most out of it, you'll be good.
I won't say I had done everything right, but I'm trying my best and as far as I am I don't regret a thing. I'm still trying to stabilize my life but so far I've won a lot of friends, experiences and knowledge. Im just basically missing someone.

I feel that there is an event in my life, which detonated a bigger change on me, which has been influencing my decisions and has sculped me and my life the way it is right now. I'll call that the spark. The name, because of how insignificant that event seemed at the moment and it still looks when I look backgwards in my life. But OMG the echo it has had in my life.
