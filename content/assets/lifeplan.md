There are two quotes that explain why I post this, and why it is useful for you to have a Life Plan.

*“Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.* -Paulo Coehlo.
and
*“Every moment of one's existence one is growing into more or retreating into less.”* -N. Mailer.

If we don't have an objective we'll never be able to move forward and therefore won't reach nowhere. If we don't improve as persons, we'll get worse. In life there's no standby where we can stay, because life goes on with or without us.

Therefore to have a direction, a goal, a plan for our lifes is good and necessary. Here, I propose the format of a life plan. 
It is important that the objectives are described according to the SMART methodology and that the time for achieving them lies in a near future. In other words, the changes in our way of living should be seen every week. 

_How to use this?_

1. Take a time for introspection.
2. Fill in each section.
3. Define your goals and means as concrete as possible (when, where, how).
4. Review this plan daily or weekly.
5. Evaluate what's missing, what should be changed, what can be done better.

# The Life Plan

### Motivational Phrase
- *This phrase should inspire you to keep going when things get tough.*
	
### Who I want to be?
- *This is a description of the best version of yourself that you strive to be in a middle term.*
*This should be a definition of yourself rather than of the external things.*
	
### Obstacles
- *These are the obstacles that are or could be in your way to your personal goal (external).*
	
### Weaknesses
- *These are your negative behaviours or habits that get in your way to become a better person (internal).*
	
### Strengths
- *These are your talents, positive traits and qualities. Everything that makes you shine on a daily basis (internal).*
	
### Personal Dimensions
*These are the dimensions of a person. In each dimension there should be something you want to do / to do better, that's the Goal.*
*For every goal, there are the means to reach it.*
*The goal and the means should be as concrete as possible, so they can be measured.*
