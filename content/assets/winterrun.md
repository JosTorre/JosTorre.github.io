A year ago I was wondering what gear would I need to run during winter. With winter I mean: Snow and minus degrees. Now, I can tell, based on experience, how it is like to run in the snow, and what kind of equipment is needed to enjoy a nice cold run.

With the following gear I would dare to run from temperatures of -1°C to -12°C.

### Gear

- Technical beanie
- Running glasses
- Bandana
- Thermal long sleve baselayer t-shirt
- Running t-shirt
- Running gloves
- Thermal baselayer legging
- Winter running tights
- Socks
- Winter running spikes
- Running shoes
- Wind + Waterproof lightjacket

*If you still find it very cold, you can add a thin cotton hoodie, nevertheless I always get very warm after 10 minutes of running without a hoodie. 
*If your toes get cold easily, you can wear wool technical running socks.
