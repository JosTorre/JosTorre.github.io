At night, when the day is gone and nothing is left but to sleep to be fully charged for the next day, the next challenge, it is worth having a small reflection to overview how our day has been and how have we been. 
Here I propose some questions to reflect before going to bed in order to improve:

- What have I done today?
- How much time did I invest in each thing today?
- What are the highlights of my day?
- Did I fulfull my objectives for today?
- What could have I done better?
- What can I do better tomorrow?
- Did I make someone's life happier / better?
- Did I help anybody?
- Which blessings did I receive today?
- What am I grateful for today?
