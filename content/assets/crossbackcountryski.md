What is that? Well, it is like crosscountry skiing, but with a backpack and offroad. aka: Badass cool shit.
Last weekend I had my first cross backcountry skiing experience. It was amazing. Therefore I thought of writing about it in case anyone wants to do it or is about to do it and wants to know how to be prepared.
This is based on my experience. Following, I describe the conditions as well as the equipment I took with me that worked. I would do it again with the same gear. I also add some extra things that could help taking with you.

### Context

- Location: Langlandsvollen, Trondelag, Norway, in the middle of nowhere.
- Temperature: -12°C to -15°C
- Weather: Clear sky
- Distance to Goal: 6km (geodesic distance).

We, a group of 4 people, were to reach a cabin in the middle of the wilderness to spend the night there and come back next day. We planned to go there by cross country skiing. Weather conditiones were kind of extreme as we had very cold temperatures and a lot of snow. We had the coordinates of the cabin and that was basically it.
