## The Morning Loading

Before officially starting a day, I think it is a great idea to consider and reflect a few things. Here I propose some questions to ask before going out of our rooms:

- What do I want to accomplish today?
- Who might be having a hard time today that i can help?
- With hom haven't I spoken in a long time that I can contact today?
- What did I miss yesterday that I can do today?
- What can I change from yesterday today?
- What do my plans for today look like?
- What might be the obstacles today for me to accomplish my goals?
