If you're reading this, I suppose, is because you got interested and wanted to know more. In this case thanks for gifting me your time and congratulations.

What you see, has been created because of two main reasons: 

1. The need of sharing with others.
2. A person who inspired me to do this in order to save thoughts and knowledge in order to improve, to whom I dedicate this website.

So, this is my first draft. That means... don't take it too seriously and don't judge this that hard lol.

It's hard to summarize a person in words, because persons are infinite.

What can I say about myself? - That is way better to get to know me in person. But maybe I can share something new or not that obvious about me through this post.

Disclaimer: I'm just a person, with imperfections and dreams.

Here some facts about me:

#### I'm + *bulletpoint*

- __dynamic__: I like to stay always active. Maybe it's thanks to FOMO or to overthinking, that I like always be 'on the move'. Life happens once and the fear of looking back to an unlived life frightens me.
- __social__: even though sometimes I may appear lonely, I do need people. I love befriending new persons and learning from them. Fun fact: I don't like eating alone.
- __curious__: I always like to learn new things, to visit new places, to experience new stuff and to understand. 
- __deep__: it is normal for me to lead almost any conversation to a deep talk. In some way, there, at deep talks one may get to know people better.
- __spontaneous__: maybe because of my background in Mexico, I have learnt to improvise, adapt and always be ready for almost any situation.
- __resourceful__: I'll find a way to make it happen.
- __mexican__: I grew up in a culture of friendly, resielent people who dream big and make fun of death.

So much for now... I'm going to go sleep and wake up early to book a damn cabin somewhere in the middle of Norway. 

Buneas noches Zzz...
