So, this is my first draft. That means... don't take it too seriously and don't judge this that hard lol.

It's hard to summarize a person in words, because persons are infinite.

What can I say about myself? That is way better to get to know me in person. But maybe I can share something new or not that obvious through this post.
Here some facts about me:

### I'm + (bulletpoint)

- dynamic: I like to stay always active. Maybe it's thanks to FOMO or overthinking that I like always be doing something. Life happens once and the fear of looking back to an unlived life frightens me.
- social: even though sometimes I may appear lonely I need people. I love befriending new people and learning from them. Fun fact: I don't like eating alone.
- curious: I always like to learn new things, to visit new places, to experience new stuff. 
- deep: It is normal for me to lead almost any conversation to a deep talk. In some way, there, at deep talks can you know people better.
- spontaneous: Maybe because my background in Mexico, I have learnt to improvise and always be ready for almost any situation.

So much for now... Im going to go sleep and wake up early to book a damn cabin somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Norway. 

Buneas noches Zzz...
