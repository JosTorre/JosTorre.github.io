We didn’t choose one of the international car companies because their prices for insurance were unfair, as cars should already be mostly insured in Iceland, paying extra shouldn’t be required. I must tell that my experience picking up the car was way better than what I’m used to with other companies. We just needed to basically scan our QR code that was sent by email after reserving and paying online, go to the counter, confirm that the reservation details were correct, and immediately we got the car keys. All these steps were done in less than 3 minutes; a dream. Of course, we booked the cheapest car available.\nSo here is the first impresion I had on ground from Iceland:\nYes, there are no trees. In the early days of Iceland, there were some trees, but settlers deforested and because of obvious climate and soil conditions none grew back. That created the erosioned landscape that nowadays we see on Iceland.
